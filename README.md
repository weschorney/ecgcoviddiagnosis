This repository contains the code related to a manuscript exploring COVID-19 diagnosis based on ECG images. Information on the code can be found in the manuscript, which will be linked when the manuscript is published. The code uses stratified cross validation to train a model on the ECG Covid dataset available [here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/gwbz3fsgp8/1). 

Please cite the manuscript when using the code. The BibTeX citation will be added when the manuscript is published.
